# EE-552-WS-FinalProject - Quiz Designer

## Key Components
* Ability to create a new quiz and add questions
* Questions of three different types: true/false, multiple choice, and fill in the blank(/short answer/free response)
* Each question can be configured to have unique prompts, answer keys, and point values
* File input/output to save quizzes as JSON and modify existing quizzes by opening from a local directory

## Additional Feature Ideas
* Exporting a preview of the quiz as a text file
* Take the quiz from within the program and save the responses
* Autograding multiple filled out quizzes at once
* Analysis of autograded quizzes to show min/max score and average score

## Class Hierarchy
* *Main* class (terminal-based user interface)
* *QuizDesigner* (functions relating to creating and editing quizzes)
* *QuizHandler* (functions relating to exporting, taking, and grading quizzes)
* *Quiz* class (data container for quiz JSONs)
  * Composed of objects of the *Question* data container class
    * *MultipleChoiceQuestion* class
    * *TrueFalseQuestion* class
    * *FillInTheBlankQuestion* class
* *AutogradeResult* (data container for auto result JSONs)

## Directory Hierarchy
* `quizzes` (output for creating quizzes, input/output for editing quizzes, input for taking quizzes)
* `quizToBeGraded` (output for taking quizzes, input for autograding tests)
* `autoResult` (output for exported quiz text files and compiling all autograded test responses)
* `src` (source code for Maven project)


## Instructions
1. Clone the GitHub repo: https://github.com/andrewcapro/EE-552-WS-FinalProject
2. Make sure Maven is installed
3. In the `EE-552-WS-FinalProject` directory, type in the terminal `mvn clean` to clean artifacts
4. In the same directory, type in the terminal `mvn compile exec:java` to compile and run
5. Experiment with creating, taking and editing quizzes!  
  
Please only use JSONs generated by the program as using other JSONs not conforming to our standard may break things unexpectedly.  
  
Sample files are provided for a `Math Quiz` example including the quiz itself as a JSON to edit, the exported text file for the quiz, a few filled-out responses for the quiz by different students, and autograder results for these students.  
  
Ensure that response JSONs in the quizToBeGraded folder all match your chosen answer key as the program is safeguarded to prevent grading mismatched quizzes.
